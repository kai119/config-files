# config-files

This repository contains configuration files that I use to set up various applications my development environment

## NeoVim configuration

the `vim` directory contains the configuration files needed to setup NeoVim as a development environment. Files included are:

- `init.vim` - the init file that is run when nvim opens, contains all plugins and their basic setup
- `coc-settings.json` - the settings for the COC autocompletion plugin

To configure NeoVim using these files, vim-plug needs to be installed. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
